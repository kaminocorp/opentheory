"""Project membership + authorization service (0.8.1).

The project-level analog of ``core.roles`` / ``require_internal``: ``ensure_can_manage`` is the
single gate every project-management write composes with. Authorization is keyed on the **account**
(the principal, 0.7.0) — an actor manages a project iff its owning account holds a ``ProjectMember``
row for that project. Account-less actors (``system`` / dev-bootstrap) have no principal and can
never manage.

Status codes (matching the rest of the API): unauthenticated → ``401`` (handled upstream by the
``ActingActor`` dependency, before this service runs); missing project → ``404``; signed-in
non-member (or, for owner-only actions, a mere admin) → ``403``.

Membership is access control, **not** intellectual credit — it lives in its own table and never
touches Contribution / Validation / FundingAllocation (the funder/contributor/validator separation).
